# TheClaw
A continuation of  project from my Computer Engineering Technology Capstone. 
I am collecting and logging everything I can find as I go through my schoolwork.

Version1 of this project 
Physical:
power supply (servos and stepper need about 12v 4a)
buck converter (my power supply isnt variable so I used this. the stepper and servos also need different voltages)
1 small bread board
1 Arduino UNO R3
3d printed components. (Models used are from someone elses design. I will post the links if I find them while I am logging the project)
1 stepper motor
1 stepper driver
6 servos 
assorted screws (It would be a lot of effort to dissassemble the physical device to count this. If I find the original plans I will update this.)
assorted wires
aprox. 50 ball bearings
Code:
Visual C# application uses sliders for value inputs that are given to an Arduino UNO R3 that controls the electrical components.
