# TheClaw

A continuation of  project from my Computer Engineering Technology Capstone (Microprocessor Integration). 
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1 of this project is the result of the Computer Engineering Technology capstone. 
Team: John Sliva, Adam Agoglia, Krzysztof Ostaszewski, Lucas Goodwin
This is a 3d printed robotic claw that is controlled by a combination of Arduino and visual C#.

**While this was a group project all uploads to this repo will be from me as I will be building the repo from my personal files**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 2 of this project is a continuation of this project where I will be working on alternate means of controlling the claw. 
This includes a few minor changes to the hardware as well but will mostly be software focused.
